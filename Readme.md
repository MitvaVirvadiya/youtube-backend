# YouTube Clone Project - Learning Backend with Chai Aur Code

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my YouTube Clone project where I'm diving into the exciting world of backend development using JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I'm following along with the amazing tutorials from Hitesh Choudhary sir's YouTube channel, 'Chai Aur Code.'

## Project Overview

This project is my hands-on journey to create a simplified version of YouTube. From setting up the backend server with Node.js and Express.js to managing data in MongoDB, I'm learning the ropes of backend development. The goal is to understand how things work behind the scenes of a video-sharing platform like YouTube.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** The runtime that allows me to run JavaScript on the server-side.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies building robust APIs.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data efficiently.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/MitvaVirvadiya/youtube-backend.git)
   cd youtube-clone-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up MongoDB:**
   Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running. Update the connection string in `config/db.js`.

4. **Run the Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server should be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Implementing user registration and login functionality.
- **Video Upload:** Allowing users to upload their videos to the platform.
- **Video Playback:** Building the video playback feature for users to watch uploaded videos.
- **Comments and Likes:** Adding the ability for users to comment on and like videos.

## Learning Resources

- [Chai Aur Code YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7ZcDKe3WzU9uhUnsZvK4gQ): Hitesh Choudhary's tutorials are gold for learning backend development.
